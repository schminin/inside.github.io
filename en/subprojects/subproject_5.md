### Subproject 5: Data Collection

![title_image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Wasserprobenentnahme.png)

In SP 5, we are adding to existing datasets to support the construction of models for the sewer network system, to validate the INSIDe platform and to assess the possibility of using wastewater samples in early warning systems. \\
To this end, we will conduct pulse-chase experiments in the sewer network at sites in Munich and Addis Ababa, which will provide us with information about flow patterns in the sewer network. These results will facilitate the creation and validation of models of the wastewater network (SP3). Furthermore, we will conduct targeted analyses of wastewater samples that will provide us with information on selected infectious diseases (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 variants) or the concentration of enterovirus spp. or other viruses that cause local outbreaks, such as the norovirus. The analytical results will be provided to SP1 on an ongoing basis to evaluate the platform and will serve as a basis for SP2 and SP3/4 to improve the model. SP5 will use the results of SP1 to optimise the placement of existing and newly acquired wastewater sampling equipment.\\
In addition, we perform untargeted DNA and RNA sequencing of wastewater samples for the establishment of an early warning system. The sequencing results are matched with entries in a pathogen database to detect unforeseen pathogens in wastewater.\\

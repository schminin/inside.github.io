Public health crises, such as a pandemic, require decisive policy action. Governments can
pursue a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions of varying intrusiveness, ranging from
voluntary social distancing of individuals to a mandatory shutdown of the country. These
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) do influence the spread of diseases and can avoid an
overload of the healthcare system.
Population-based modeling of the spread of infections has proven indispensable for informing
the decision making process. Yet, the insights and forecasts provided by existing models are
necessarily limited by their resolution and the data on which they are based. Furthermore, the
focusing on individual disease entities disregards indirect interactions and cross-immunity. To
address these issues, the interdisciplinary project INSIDe will develop refined models and data
integration strategies, to allow for the integrative spatio-temporal modelling of the spread of
multiple diseases on multiple levels of resolution. In contrast to existing approaches, we will also
employ spatially distributed wastewater sampling, which has been demonstrated to function as
an early indicator for the rise of reported infections and hospitalizations.
The modular, open-source platform developed within INSIDe will allow for the integration of
different models and modelling approaches for transmission and observation. This will facilitate
the integration of different information, ranging from officially reported case numbers over
wastewater sampling results all the way to data extracted from social media, and ultimately
provide an improved understanding of the impact of testing strategies and NPIs.
